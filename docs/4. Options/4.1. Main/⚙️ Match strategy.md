- `prefix` (default)
- `partial`

## Examples

### prefix

Input `orange` doesn't suggest `appleOrangeGrape` because it doesn't start with `orange` or `Orange`.

## Notes

There are two crucial points you should know.

- `partial` suggests many suggestions, it might be noisy for you depending on the situation
- `partial` is more than **10 times slower** than `prefix`
